# Getting started

Let's get started by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is a free and opensource distribution of the Python and R programming language for scientific computing. It uses [conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) and comes with essential python packages such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and many more.

+ Before, starting the discussion lets get familier with the following basic data types:
String, integer, float, complex, enum, dictionary and Boolean. Please go through the **datatypes.ipynb** file to see the details.

+ The go through the basic built in functions and loops in python 

+ Pre-requisites: Check if "matplotlib" and "numpy" libraries are already installed. You check it by typing:
```python

    import matplotlib
    import numpy

    print("matplotlib version: {}".format({matplotlib.__version__}))
    print("numpy version: {}".format({numpy.__version__}))
```

If not already installed you can install it from the links:
