## Getting started with Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is open-source and available for installation to almost all OS platforms. Because of it's simplicity and accessibility, it is widely used by researchers, data scientists, web-developers, students and many more. The language itself was born almost 30 years ago. It has vast documentation, tutorials and huge community support. There are hundreds of libraries available for scientific computing, data analysis, plotting, machine learning, automation, electronics simulation, FDTD, 3D design and much more.

## Installation
Pyhton now a days comes pre-installed with all major operating system Windows, MacOS and Linux. If your OS does not have python interpreter which you can check by running "python" in the Linux or Mac terminal or in commandline for windows, you can install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can use popular IDE's such as PyCharm, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Atom etc for intelligent and fast development. 

I would personally recommend you to use [CONDA](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package and enviroment manager for programming and development in python or any other language. It automaticall updates and manages thousands of packages with just a single command. It also separates your working enviroment from test enviroments. You can even create different test enviroment with diffterent versions of python and it automatically manages all dependencies and does not break your system.   

You can install [CONDA](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) directly from the terminal or command line or you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is a free and opensource distribution of Python and R programming language for scientific computing. It uses [conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) and comes with preinstalled essential python packages such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and IDEs such as Jupyter-Notebook, Jupyter-Lab, Spyder etc.

For this tutorials, I am using Jupyter-Lab which comes preinstalled with Anaconda distribution. If you are not using Anaconda distribution and you installed conda package manager only then you can install Jupyter-Lab from [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).


## Tutorial
As, I am continuously working on this tutorial project, I will be continuously updating my content. Feel free to contact me at <mv4manishverma@gmail.com> for any questions, sugestions or help.

The content of my tutorials are:

**1. Basic data types in python:** Please go through the **datatypes.ipynb** file to see the details.

**2. Built-in Pyhton Functions and loops:** The go through the basic built in functions and loops in python
