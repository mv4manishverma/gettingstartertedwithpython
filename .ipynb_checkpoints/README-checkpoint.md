## Getting started with Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is open-source and available for installation to almost all OS platforms. Because of it's simplicity and accessibility, it is widely used by researchers, data scientists, web-developers, students and many more. The language itself was born almost 30 years ago. It has vast documentation, tutorials and huge community support. There are hundreds of libraries available for scientific computing, data analysis, plotting, machine learning, automation, electronics simulation, FDTD, 3D design and much more.

## Installation
Python, now a days, comes pre-installed with all major operating system Windows, MacOS and Linux. If your OS does not have python interpreter which you can check by running "python" in the Linux or Mac terminal or in command line for windows, you can install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can use popular IDE's such as PyCharm, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Atom etc for intelligent and fast development. 

I would personally recommend you to use [CONDA](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package and enviroment manager for programming and development in python or any other language. It automatically updates and manages thousands of packages with just a single command. It also separates your working enviroment from test enviroments. You can even create different test enviroment with diffterent versions of python and it automatically manages all dependencies and does not break your system.   

You can install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to get conda package manager and then you have to install some libraries such as [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html#installing-using-your-linux-distribution-s-package-manager), [matplotlib](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/). You can then install [Jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) to follow my tutorials. You can also use any other IDE instead of Jupyter-lab.  

If you want to avoid the hassle of manual installation of many packages, you can just install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution. Anaconda is a free and opensource distribution of Python and R programming language for scientific computing. It uses [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)  package manager and comes with essential python packages preinstalled. It also comes with IDEs such as Jupyter-Notebook, Jupyter-Lab, Spyder preinstalled. So you don't have to install anything after that.

For the tutorials, I am using Jupyter-Lab which comes preinstalled with Anaconda distribution. If you are not using Anaconda distribution can also follow me from any other IDE.


## Tutorial
As, I am continuously working on this tutorial project, I will be continuously updating my content. Feel free to contact me at <mv4manishverma@gmail.com> for any questions, sugestions or help.

The content of my tutorials are:

**1. Basic data types in python:** Please go through the **datatypes.ipynb** file to see the details.

**2. Built-in Python Functions and loops:** Please go through the file **builtinfunctiosandloops.ipynb** to see most useful built in functions and loops in python.

**3. Built-in Python operators:** Please refer to the file **operatorsinpython.ipynb** to go through most used operators in python.
